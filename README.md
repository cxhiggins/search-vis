# search-vis
The Design and Analysis of Algorithms course that I am taking discusses various graph search algorithms. Some examples of these algorithms include BFS (breadth-first search), DFS (depth-first search), Dijkstra's, and Bellman Ford's. I have created programs that visualize these search algorithms on randomly generated graphs, to make it easier to conceptualize what the algorithms do.

So far, I have only developed visualization software for BFS, but others should be coming soon!
